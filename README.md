# Installation

Create your React app

Open a terminal(Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell).

Create a new project folder: mkdir ReactProjects and enter that directory: cd ReactProjects.

Install React using create-react-app, a tool that installs all of the dependencies to build and run a full React.js application:

PowerShell

Copy
npx create-react-app my-app
yarn create-react-app my-app

# Usage

On an everyday basis, many people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them. This website can be used for planning ahead.
